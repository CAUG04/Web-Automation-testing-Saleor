# Introduction

A project that exemplifies the use of the Serenity [ScreenPlay](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/theserenitybook/latest/screenplay-selenium-tasks.html) pattern with Cucumber and Gradle.

The tests in this example are run on the [Saleor](https://demo.saleor.io/) website.

By default, the tests run in Chrome, so you need to have the latest version of the Chrome driver installed and add it as a variable in the system path.


# Testing Serenity

Serenity provides a large number of built-in Screenplay tasks that make interacting with a web application quicker and easier to write. 
In this chapter, we will look at everything you need to know to write web tests with Serenity Screenplay.
